so i have completed my internship that i have got from oasis infobyte and i am grateful for it and the internship mainly focus on HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.Due to this internship i have known the real meaning of what the project based learning actually is and it is easier to learn from the projects rather than tutorials.My suggestion is if you want to learn webdevelopement faster first go through the documentation that will be available on google and choose any one documentation that you are comfortable with and do projects,internship and apply the content of what you have learnt in the projects,internships thats it.So this is basically my perspective on learning through internships,projects.
